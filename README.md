# README

## Overview
This project focuses on using existing detectors to detect **code** and **comments** that are likely generated by LLMs.
It consists of two major components:

1. **Code Detection** — based on *DetectCodeGPT*  
2. **Comment Detection** — based on *DetectRL*

## Data Download
Please refer to the **`data/`** directory for downloading the required repositories.

## Code Detection
For detecting code, please refer to:

- [DetectCodeGPT](https://github.com/YerbaPage/DetectCodeGPT)

The repository includes:

- Data preparation
- DetectCodeGPT Usage

## Comment Detection
For detecting comments, please refer to:

- [DetectRL](https://github.com/NLP2CT/DetectRL)

This repository provides:

- Benchmark Construction
- Different Detectors


## Code Clone Detection
For detecting code clone, please refer to:

- [CCFinderX](https://github.com/gpoo/ccfinderx)
- [GPTCloneBench](https://github.com/srlabUsask/GPTCloneBench)
